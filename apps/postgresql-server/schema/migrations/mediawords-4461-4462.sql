-- This is a Media Cloud PostgreSQL schema difference file (a "diff") between schema
-- versions 4461 and 4462.
--
-- If you are running Media Cloud with a database that was set up with a schema version
-- 4461, and you would like to upgrade both the Media Cloud and the
-- database to be at version 4462, import this SQL file:
--
--     psql mediacloud < mediawords-4461-4462.sql
--
-- You might need to import some additional schema diff files to reach the desired version.

-- 1 of 2. Import the output of 'apgdiff':
