-- This is a Media Cloud PostgreSQL schema difference file (a "diff") between schema
-- versions 4704 and 4705.
--
-- If you are running Media Cloud with a database that was set up with a schema version
-- 4704, and you would like to upgrade both the Media Cloud and the
-- database to be at version 4705, import this SQL file:
--
--     psql mediacloud < mediawords-4704-4705.sql
--
-- You might need to import some additional schema diff files to reach the desired version.
