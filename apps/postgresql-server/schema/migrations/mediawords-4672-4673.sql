DROP FUNCTION copy_chunk_of_nonpartitioned_sentences_to_partitions(story_chunk_size INT);

-- Copy a chunk of story sentences from a non-partitioned "story_sentences" to a
-- partitioned one:
--
-- * Expects starting and ending stories_id instead of a chunk size in order to
--   avoid index bloat that would happen when copying sentences in sequential
--   chunks
-- * Copies directly to partitions to skip (slow) INSERT triggers on
--   "story_sentences" view
-- * Disables all triggers while copying to skip updating db_row_last_updated
--
-- Returns number of rows that were copied.
--
-- Call this repeatedly to migrate all the data to the partitioned table.
