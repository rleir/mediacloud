Authentication / authorization
==============================

Media Cloud contains a basic authentication and authorization system that must be used. At the time of writing, there is no way to explicitly disable the authentication and authorization. Even if you are the only user of your deployment, you still have to create a user for yourself and assign an "admin" role to it.

Quick start
-----------

To add a user with an email address "your@email.com", full name "Your Name",
described as "Media Cloud administrator", having an "admin" role and a
"yourpassword123" password, run:

    manage_users.pl \
        --action=add \
        --email="your@email.com" \
        --full_name="Your Name" \
        --notes="Media Cloud administrator" \
        --roles="admin" \
        --password="yourpassword123"

To log in, open:

    http://127.0.0.1:3000/login


User management
---------------

You can manage (add, remove, change various properties) users via:

1. API (`/api/v2/users/*` endpoints),
2. CLI script located at `./script/manage_users.pl`.

For the information on how to use the user management CLI script, please
open script with a text editor and read the documentation on the top of the
file. Alternatively, you can run:

    # user manager's help
    manage_users.pl --help

or

    # user manager action's help
    manage_users.pl --action=...

Authorization code
-------------------

To edit which web pages require which roles, edit (lib/MediaWords.pm)[../lib/MediaWords.pm].

Supporting tables
-----------------

The auth code uses the following underlying tables, which define the users and their roles and also track user
api requests:

* auth_users - list of users
* auth_roles - list of auth roles
* auth_users_tag_set_permissions - tracks which users are allowed to edit which tag sets
